the size of the world and the position of the objects
the ~Item when to use and why it was calling while running the level
the delay that was used in the game.cpp why it was blinking
is frames important??? if yes we need to fix it

freeing the memory for the level 
descourtors in the code
Again follow the behavaiour of the descrutors

ask lui about if i can create an object of new if it can inheart;

class item{};
class player :public item{};
item** map = new item[3];
for(int i = 0; i<3; i++)
item[i] = new player();

 see if i can do the recusion or iterator in the checkMove() function speacilly in for checking the second object movement
 
***consider to add the convertion between the position and the x;y for the objects or set the place of drawing only it depends
***during the move check the we can move that to a funciton I belive or I need to check it again
*** the images of the empty I might consider to change them to " " or I have to make the image to null
*** the map the position of the goal can't be swapped but I didn't want to make uninizilaed so for that I initilzed the type to target

** one problem that I used to have is the initialztion of the player and it turns about that I didn't pass it to the actions with &
